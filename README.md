# Feedback Sytem implementation in Python
## FeedBack systems are EVERY WHERE
## Why do we need them?
  feeback are a way for managers, programmers, for sellers, vendors mostly everyone who want to interact with each and everyone coming in direct contact with its products.
   especially this is taken in case of software to say that owners of systems, will bring to users a possibility to give their thoughts ðŸ’­  so that the software can be juged efficiently 
    Is this software or system the desired solution for our company? 
    ðŸ™‹ if so?? how can we ensure of that???
     **answer** : By directly asking users ðŸ‘¥.
### Always they are in Webstites why using simple python? instead of bottle, django, FLASK and so on??
            On the market they are many libraries, packages for python in terms of web development.
            **KNOWING** that the logic for this system for being part of a standalone system or being part of a web system which is by deduction bigger than it, IS STILL THE SAME.
            That's why we prefered using Normal Python and it's up to every one, to use the desired Framework to implement this system for a website using python.
